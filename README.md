# About Me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m Christo, an aspiring software engineer based out of Chicago, IL.
- ðŸ‘€ Some of my many interests include History, Traveling, Science Fiction, Theatre, Cooking, Astronomy, Video Games, and on and on the list goes!
- ðŸŒ± I just graduated from App Academy's Software Engineering course, and I'm currently working on fleshing out my capstone project, a full-stack web app designed to emulate popular site Etsy, but set in the comically grim Warhammer 40K universe.
