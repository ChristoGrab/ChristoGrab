- üßë‚Äçüíª I'm currently working as a fullstack engineer on the Extensibility team at [Airbyte](https://airbyte.com/). We take ownership of a list of critical integrations, and support the long-tail of community-built connectors in our ever-growing catalog by leveraging the speed and simplicity of the UI-based Connector Builder, alongside our official connectors CDK.
- üå± After graduating from App Academy's intensive Software Engineering program in December 2022, I've continued to grow every day, first as a freelance web developer and now through my work with Airbyte. Whenever I feel stuck or in a rut, I look back at how much progress has been made with each passing year and acknowledge the growth in knowledge and confidence. Onwards and upwards!
- üé≠ Before switching focuses to pursue my passion for software, I was an actor in New York.  I performed in dozens of plays, indie films, and even a couple of commercial voice-over spots.
- üß≥ One of my great loves in life is traveling. I spent a life-changing four months backpacking with my partner through the entirety of Central America in 2022, starting in Mexico City and working our way overland across 45 destinations in 8 countries until finally reaching Panama City. Since then we've explored Colombia, Senegal and Morocco
- üëÄ Some of my many other interests outside software include history, science fiction, cooking, video games, and on and on the list goes!
